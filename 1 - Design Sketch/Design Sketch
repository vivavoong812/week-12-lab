Part 1: Design Sketch

Final Output: 
Our function will output a summary table containing the recommended number of bikes placed at each station. Additionally, we will create a
line graph that shows bike usage over time at each station. 

Outline the high‑level steps, from data input to final results. Continue breaking down these steps until each piece is simple enough to be 
contained in its own function.
  1. Calculate the number of bike usage per hour and per day.
  2. Simulate a day
      a. simulate with exponential distribution using the estimated rates
      b. thin data to generate accurate representation of trips
  3. "Optimize" bike placement
      a. using simualated data to determine number of bikes placed at each station
  4. Display results
      a. table
      b. line graph
  
* estimation
  description: create function that estimates the arrival rates for each station, day, and hour
  inputs: data frame w/ start_station, end_station, start_time, end_time, hour, day
  outputs: start_station, end_station, hour, day, est_arr_rate

* simulation
  description: simulating trips per station with lambda
  inputs: start_station, end_station, hour, est_arr_rate
  outputs: start_station, end_station, est_arr_times

*placement
  description: optimizing bike placement
  inputs: start_station, end_station, est_arr_times, max_bike
  outputs: start_station, end_station, num_bike  

Draw a function dependency diagram showing the dependence of functions on each other.
  estimation --> simulation --> placement

Refine by considering where you could minimize redundancy or update the inputs/outputs to improve your design.
