Part 1: Design Sketch

Final Output: 
Our function will output a summary table containing the recommended number of bikes placed at each station. Additionally, we will create a
line graph that shows bike usage over time at each station. 

Outline the high‑level steps, from data input to final results. Continue breaking down these steps until each piece is simple enough to be 
contained in its own function.

List your functions. For each function include:

Function name

Inputs (with data types)

Outputs (with formats)

Short description of its purpose

Draw a function dependency diagram showing the dependence of functions on each other.

Refine by considering where you could minimize redundancy or update the inputs/outputs to improve your design.
