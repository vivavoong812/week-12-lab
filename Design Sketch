Part 1: Design Sketch

Define the final output: What should the manager receive (e.g., a table of recommended bikes per station, an expected‑usage plot)?

Outline the high‑level steps, from data input to final results. Continue breaking down these steps until each piece is simple enough to be contained in its own function.

List your functions. For each function include:

Function name

Inputs (with data types)

Outputs (with formats)

Short description of its purpose

Draw a function dependency diagram showing the dependence of functions on each other.

Refine by considering where you could minimize redundancy or update the inputs/outputs to improve your design.
